**Introdution**:  
This is my first repositories, where I want to share some information, my personal collection and note. The most part is about math, which is my majority.  
Before the repositories, I would like to use Onenote to stroge all my note and collection. But I frequently find, that for some reason (forbidden Onedrive Website) it is so difficult in main land a Onenote to share with my friends. So am I here.
Nowsdays the almost thing is written in Chinese or English. Maybe in future some documents will be written with German.
